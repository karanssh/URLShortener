# URLShortener
Result of challenge to create a functioning URL shortener within 2H. 
For storage of URLs, using boltdb to use file based DB 

NOTE: This is no way production ready, its a simple POC I made because of a stupid drunk idea

# Dependencies
 - mux for routing
 - boltdb for storage
 - go-hashids to generate short URLs
